# README: Clock Project Reflection

---

## Project Overview

Within this C++ project, I embarked on the creation of a simulated clock. Its primary objective is to showcase the distinction and conversion between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats. For someone newly acquainted with the intricacies of programming, this project was a first step into real-time manipulations and clock logic.

## Strengths

- **Structured Approach**: My decision to encapsulate the logic of the clock within the `Clock` class allowed for a cleaner and more organized codebase. I believe this is foundational in C++ and object-oriented programming.
- **User Interface**: I developed an interactive menu for the user, making the program more dynamic and user-friendly.

## Areas of Improvement

- **Boundary Handling**: While I addressed overflow during time display, it might be more efficient to manage these overflows immediately after time additions.
- **Input Validation**: The program would be more robust with comprehensive input validation to prevent unexpected behaviors.
- **Code Duplication**: The duplicated `Clock` class definitions need rectification. This was an oversight, but I understand the importance of clean code to prevent confusion.

## Challenges

Grasping the logic behind the AM/PM designations in the 12-hour format was initially perplexing. By methodically breaking down the problem and referencing trusted C++ documentation, I surmounted this challenge. StackOverflow was another valuable resource during this process, and I am progressively integrating such platforms into my study routine.

## Skills Acquired

Learning to design a class in C++, handling user input, and managing time calculations have all been pivotal. I foresee these skills being applicable to numerous future projects in C++ and possibly other languages as well.

## Ensuring Quality Code

- **Maintainability**: I strived for clarity by segmenting distinct functionalities into their respective functions, facilitating any future modifications.
- **Readability**: Through consistent commenting and logical naming conventions, I aimed for the code to be accessible, not just to myself but to any other learner or reviewer.
- **Adaptability**: The class structure of the clock lends itself well to future extensions or modifications, underlining the importance of forward-thinking in code design.
