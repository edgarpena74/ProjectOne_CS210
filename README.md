# Clock Project Reflection

---

## Overview

I made a C++ program that can show time in both the regular 12-hour format and the military 24-hour style.

## What I'm Proud Of

- I built a `Clock` class that keeps everything tidy.
- I added a menu so users can interact with the clock.

## Things To Fix

- It'd be good to check if users put in something unexpected.

## Tough Spots

Getting the AM/PM stuff right for the 12-hour clock took some time. I read up on some C++ tips and asked for help on StackOverflow.

## New Things I Learned

- Practiced creating classes
- How to show and adjust time correctly.
- Dealing with choices users make.

## How I Kept Things Clear

- I made sure each part of the code has its own job. It's easier to understand and change later.
- I used comments in the code so others can follow along.
- I set things up so that, if I want, I can add more features in the future.
